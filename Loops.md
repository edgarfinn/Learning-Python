## Loops

#### For loops
```python
for i in range(x [,y]):
  # do something
```
Where `i` is the current iteration in a total number of x iterations. Or if `y` is also specified, the number of iterations will count from `x` and stop when it reaches `y` (which will not be included).

For example:

```python
for num in range(3):
  print(num)
# 0
# 1
# 2

for i in range(5, 8):
  print(i)
# 5
# 6
# 7
```
