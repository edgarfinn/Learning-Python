# Quick Introduction to Python

### Overview
Python is an [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language#:~:text=An%20interpreted%20language%20is%20a,program%20into%20machine%2Dlanguage%20instructions.), [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language), [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasises code readability, notable for its use of significant whitespace. It supports multiple multiple programming paradigms, including [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming), (particularly [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming.

Python is a versatile language, which lends itself to a range of applications including Web & Internet Development, Database Access, Desktop GUIs, Scientific & Numeric (including Data Analysis), Network Programming and Software and Game development.

### Grammar
A few things to note about Python's grammar. It is:
- Python is case sensitive.
- The end of a line marks the end of a statement. (No semicolon required).
- Blocks of code are grouped using indentation (as opposed to, say, curly braces).
- Comments can be denoted either as single-lines, using the `#` symbol (extending to the end of the line), or across multiple lines, using three quotation marks:
```Python
 # This is a single-line commend

 '''
 This is a multi-
 line comment
 '''
```
